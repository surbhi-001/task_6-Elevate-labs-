# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project performs data analysis on e-commerce sales data using MySQL. It includes querying and aggregating order and product information to extract business insights like monthly revenue, top-performing products, and customer purchase behavior.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The project uses two CSV files:

- `orders.csv` — Contains transaction-level order details such as:
  - `order_id`
  - `order_date`
  - `product_id`
  - `quantity`
  - `total_price`

- `products.csv` — Contains product catalog information:
  - `product_id`
  - `product_name`
  - `category`
  - `price`

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries

1. **Monthly Revenue Report**
2. **Total Orders & Quantity Sold**
3. **Top 5 Revenue-Generating Orders**
4. **Revenue by Product Category**
5. **Top 5 Best-Selling Products**
6. **Daily Revenue Breakdown**
7. **Order Volume by Month**
8. **Average Order Price per Product**
9. **Top Categories by Quantity Sold**
10. **Most Expensive Products**

These queries utilize SQL functions like:
- `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- `EXTRACT()`, `STR_TO_DATE()` for date manipulation
